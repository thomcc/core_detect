//! This crate provides a `no_std` version of std's [`is_x86_feature_detected!`]
//! macro.
//!
//! This is possible because x86 chips can just use the `cpuid` instruction to
//! detect CPU features, whereas most other architectures require either reading
//! files or querying the OS.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```
//! # #[cfg(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64"))]
//! # fn main() {
//! if core_detect::is_x86_feature_detected!("ssse3") {
//!     println!("SSSE3 is available");
//! }
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64")))]
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! Note that like the [equivalent macro in `std`][stddetect], this will error
//! on architectures other than x86/x86_64, so you should put the code behind a
//! `#[cfg(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64"))]` check.
//!
//! [stddetect]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/macro.is_x86_feature_detected.html
//!
//! (In the future, this crate may provide another macro which returns false in
//! these cases instead, and supports testing multiple features simultaneously).
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! If you use this library on a machine older than the introduction of the
//! `cpuid` instruction (that is, a machine from before around 1994), we'll end
//! up executing the instruction regardless. There's no stable way to detect
//! this currently, and in practice it's pretty difficult to target a machine
//! this old with Rust/LLVM anyway, so it's probably fine.
//!
//! If you do run this code on a machine that old, we'll exit with a `SIGILL`.
//! This might sound bad, but in practice this is how `core::intrinsics::abort`
//! typically exits, so there should be no security concerns or anything like
//! that. Ideally we'd use [`arch::x86::has_cpuid`], but this function is
//! unstable, and requires inline asm to implement.
//!
//! [`arch::x86::has_cpuid`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/arch/x86/fn.has_cpuid.html
//!
//! If this is unacceptable, you have two options (both of which are ignored
//! if we can determine this statically):
//!
//! - If are on nightly, you can enable the `unstable_has_cpuid` feature.
//!
//! - Otherwise, you can disable the on-by-default `assume_has_cpuid` feature.
//!   (This is ignored if both it and `unstable_has_cpuid` are on).
//!
//! (Also, file an issue if you really care about 30 year old machines, I have
//! some other workarounds that I can finish up in that case).
//!
//! (Note: For clarity, we *do* handle newer machines known to not have `cpuid`
//! correctly â€” for example `#[cfg(target_env = "sgx")]`)

        is_x86_feature_detected can only be used on x86 and x86_64 targets.
        You can prevent it from being used in other architectures by
        guarding it behind a cfg(target_arch) as follows:

            #[cfg(any(target_arch = "x86", target_arch = "x86_64"))] {
                if is_x86_feature_detected(...) { ... }
            }
        "#
        )
    };
}
